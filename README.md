## Introduction

Our solution is a platform that enables users to seamlessly convert social media content into comprehensive product listings. Users upload social media links, images, or videos related to a product they like. The backend fetches data from these inputs, extracting information such as product name, description, images, and price to build structured listings. These listings are then displayed on a dummy Amazon-like site where users can browse and purchase items, creating an efficient bridge between social media engagement and e-commerce.

## Usage

1. Paste the link to your social media listing in the input field on homepage or dashboard
2. Verify the auto filled form by Generative AI.
3. Click Sell on Amazon
4. Your product is listed on Amazon ðŸŽ‰
